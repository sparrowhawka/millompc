      <h2>Millom Computer Services will close during 2020.</h2>
      <p class="text-justify"> I have been running Millom Computers in my spare time since 2018, helping people with computer problems in the local the community. Throughout this time, I have operated around other work commitments, which has enabled me to offer an out-of-hours service to help people when they’re also not at work or away. <br>
        <br>
        As my other commitments have now increased, I have become less and less able to offer the rapid turnaround times that I used to, so at the start of 2020 I made the decision to wind up operations.
        This begun with the closing of all social media services in February 2020, and now our website and email services will also close on <strong>03/03/2020</strong>. <br>
        <br>
        Whilst Millom Computers will cease to exist, I will still be happy to help out my regular customers, so if you do not have it already, please request from me my personal email address and phone number, as the help@millomcomputers email will also cease to operate around the third of March. Just so you're aware, any work outstanding on 03/03/2020 will still be completed without issues, so please do not worry about this. <br>
        <br>
        Best Regards, <br>
        <em><strong>Millom Computer Services</strong></em><br>
