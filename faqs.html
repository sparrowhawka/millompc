              <h4>Parts</h4>
              <p>If we have to order in spare parts, you may have to pay a parts deposit. This is typically 40% of the cost of the parts required. Particularly rare or expensive parts may be subject to a higher deposit. <br>

                If you prefer, you can order the parts yourself. If you do, we only charge the diagnostic and fitting fees.</p>

              <p>We don't specify a mileage rate on our invoices, but call outs outside of Millom and Haverigg may cost slightly more due to the inccured travel costs.</p>
